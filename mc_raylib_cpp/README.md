## BUGS:

- Leaves and water??

## TODO 1 (aka things I might actually do)

- C++ stuff
    - Constructor initalization list
	- Improve iterating?
		- Enhanced for loops?
	- Add `f` to floats
- Block has array[6] of Vector2 texcoords (indexed by Dir) instead of getTexcoordsFn()/getTexcoords()
- World gen
	- Basic biomes
		- 2 noise maps
			- Temperature
			- Humidity
		- Plains
			- Flat
			- Lower tree chance
			- 40-75 temp
			- 25-75 humidity
			- Blocks:
				- Top 1: Grass
				- RAND(3, 5): Dirt
				- Rest - Stone
		- Forests
			- Flat-ish
			- Height tree change
			- 40-75 temp
			- 50-75 humidity
			- Blocks:
				- Top 1: Grass
				- RAND(3, 5): Dirt
				- Rest - Stone
		- Deserts
			- Flat
			- Low tree chance
				- Cactus??
			- 75-100 temp
			- 0-25 humidity
			- Blocks:
				- RAND(2, 4): Sand
				- Rest - Stone
		- Mountains
			- High
			- Low tree chance
			- Most/all temp
			- Most/all humidity
			- Snow on top
		- Beach
			- Near WATER_LEVEL
			- No trees
		- Ocean
		- Rivers
			- Near WATER_LEVEL
	- Trilinear interpolation??
	- Lower resolution Z noise?
- Performance
	- Profile??
		- `gprof build/mainWithProfile  > gprofOutput.txt`

## TODO 2 (aka everything I don't actually want to do)

- When under water, show the "top" of the water
- Glass blocks
	- Sort blocks within a chunk?
		- Or does it work already?
	- New mesh?
- Directional blocks
	- Wooden logs
- Working player
	- Collision physics
	- Player::IsSubmerged()
- Inventory
	- Hotbar
	- Break blocks -> add to inventory
		- Or maybe "float" above ground like in the actual game
	- Place blocks -> remove from inventory
- Day/night cycle
	- Sun/moon
	- Skybox
	- Lighting
- Infinite world
	- Hold only some chunks in memory
		- Live read/write to file
- World gen
	- More biomes
	- 3d perlin noise
		- "Instead of sampling the Perlin noise in two dimensions try sampling it in three and placing a cube wherever it’s greater than some threshold. It’s not as simple as a basic mesh but it lets you create complex features like caves and overhangs."
	- Made from 5 diiferent noise setups
		- +spline interpolation (or something like that)
	- Caves
- Fog
	- For far away chunks
- Flowing water
- Falling sand blocks
- "Ticks"
	- Dirt -> grass
	- Etc
- Preformance
	- Unload models from GPU when not in view
	- Store chunk block data as a list of indexes to a vector of blocks
		- Avoids repeating/duplicating block info
